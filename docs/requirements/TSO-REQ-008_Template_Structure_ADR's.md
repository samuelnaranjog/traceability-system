# Story

> [!abstract] User Story
> `User type - Action - Output`

**As a** Builder,
**I want to** quickly insert a template
**So that**  it can serve me as a framework to guide and globalized the creation of *Architectural Decision Records*

# Acceptance Criteria

> [!todo] **Scenario A:** Functional properties and callout
> `Precondition - Action - Outcome`
>
> **Given** The ADR was created with proper naming convention , **When** the builder clicks `cmd + m` and selects `???` , **Then** the ADR template that includes properties and the callout ready to edit is inserted in the note

> [!todo] **Scenario B:** Correct Inner structure of the template
> `Precondition - Action - Outcome`
>
> **Given** the template for ADRs was inserted successful , **When** I began editing.
> **Then** the Builder can clearly see the structure defined in the analytical breakdown:
>
> * Date
> * Context
> * Decision
> * Consequences
> * Reference

> [!todo] **Scenario: C** Diagram Creation
> `Precondition - Action - Outcome`
>
> **Given** the template for ADRs was inserted successful and I'm editing Decision section , **When** the builder click `cmd + m` and selects **`???`** , **Then** I can start creating the diagram as code

> [!todo] **Scenario D:** Complex problem solving
> `Precondition - Action - Outcome`
>
> **Given** the ADR is being edited and no easy solution can be found , **When** I decide to crete a board to think about it and I simply insert below the callout of the template **`Analytical Breakdown files traceability (TSO template)`** , **Then** It properly appears in the ADR file

## Analytical Breakdown

| **Problem Solving documentation** | **File**                                 |
